    Used to validate rules against environmental arguements provided as kwargs.

    rule_set can be provided which will be compiled for better performance.

    Example of rule_set in dict format:
        { 'role:admin': '"admin" in role_kwarg',
          'user:login': '"login_kwarg" is True',
          'match:both': 'role:admin or system:login' }

        The syntax for the rule is exactly as per python conditional
        statements. Note these statements can be nested using braces ().

        By default following kwargs are given to policy runtime in wsgi:
            * req being equel to the Request Object for the request.

    Keyword Args:
        rule_set (dict): Rule Set in dict loaded from JSON file for example.
