        variables in the operation. Variables are specified in a
        database-specific notation (see the module's paramstyle attribute for
        details).

        A reference to the operation will be retained by the cursor. If the
        same operation object is passed in again, then the cursor can optimize
        its behavior. This is most effective for algorithms where the same
        operation is used, but different parameters are bound to it (many
        times).

        For maximum efficiency when reusing an operation, it is best to use the
        .setinputsizes() method to specify the parameter types and sizes ahead
        of time. It is legal for a parameter to not match the predefined
        information; the implementation should compensate, possibly with a loss
        of efficiency.

        The parameters may also be specified as list of tuples to e.g. insert
        multiple rows in a single operation, but this kind of usage is
        deprecated: .executemany() should be used instead.

        Return values are not defined in the standard. However goal is to
