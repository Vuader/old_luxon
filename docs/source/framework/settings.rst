Config
======

Luxon will attempt to discover the route path when starting the handler e.g. Wsgi.
You can place a settings.ini file in the same directory of your wsgi file which is loaded by Wsgi handler.

The configuration can be access globally from g.app.config which is python configparser that has only been enhanced by adding more methods to the exisiting base Python configparser.

Python configparser implements a basic configuration language which provides a structure similar to whatâ€™s found in Microsoft Windows INI files. You can use this to write Python programs which can be customized by end users easily.

settings.ini
-------------
.. code:: ini

    # Main Application configuration
    [application]

    # Global Application name. Its seen in the logs output.
    name = Application

    # Log Level for Application root logger.
    # Default is WARNING
    log_level = WARNING

    # Log to sys.stdout. for root logger.
    log_stdout = True

    # Log to syslog server for root logger.
    # If not defined will not log to server.
    log_server = 192.168.0.1

    # Log Port for syslog server.
    log_server_port = 514

    # Log to file for root logger.
    # If not defined will not log file.
    log_file = /tmp/app.log

    # Per Module configuration.
    [package.module]

    # Log level for specific module.
    log_level = DEBUG

    # Log Stdout for specific module.
    log_stdout = False

    # Log Server for specific module.
    # If not defined will not log to server.
    log_server = 192.168.0.1
