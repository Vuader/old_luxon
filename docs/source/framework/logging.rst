Logger
======

Luxon has a builtin logger to provide a conveniant high-level common interface with extended functionality.

The logger wraps around python logging facilities and ensures that formatting and handlers are managed within the context of the python interpreter.

Example Usage
-------------

.. code:: python

    from luxon import GetLogger

    # As per per 282 use the module name.
    log = GetLogger(__name__)

    log.critical('Critical message')
    log.error('Error message')
    log.warning('Warning message')
    log.info('Informational message')
    log.debug('Debug message')

    # Returns bool if in debug mode.
    log.debug_mode() 

GetLogger Class
---------------

.. autoclass:: luxon.core.logger.GetLogger
    :members:

Request Context
---------------

You can append values to each log entry made within the context of a request by using the log dictionary provided by the request.

**An example would be:**

.. code:: python

    req.log['username'] = 'Foo'
    # This would append '(username:Foo) to logs.
